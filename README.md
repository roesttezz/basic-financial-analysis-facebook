# INTERPRETIVE ANALYSIS

7.19 liquidity may seem high, which means, as said, too much cash, but comparing to its performance in 2017, Facebook actually did a really nice try to remarkably reduce it from 12.92 to 7.19. Such reduction can be put down to its effort in boosting investment in continuous technology innovation including hardware products, long-standing initiatives, etc. To be said, Facebook is considerably using its assets and money on more areas. With the current strategy and liquidity rate, the company will be able to do much more and develop even more in the future.

Meanwhile, 45% is actually considered a high profit margin. With such impressive figures, Facebook is proved to be operating efficiently, producing its services and products at a lower cost and generating higher profits. In the short-run, it helps preventing the business from hardships with debts, expenses and owners’ income handling. In the long-run, the possible benefits are confident. By running effectively, it will gain a competitive edge in the price war, which can later act as a stable base for future profitability and promising actual income rise. Simultaneously, the more profit it generates, the more attractive the business is to investors, which then gives it even more opportunities in expanding and developing the business.

Regarding the debt-to-equity ratio, 0 is a really impressive number, but it isn't of a firm ground to conclude that this is a greatly healthy business. In the short-term, or specifically in the rise and continuous development of Facebook, it proves confidentially strong benefits expectations, because the risk is much less, considerably 0, and the additional capital stimulatingly grows. However, there is still a concern from the long-term performance. The concern is that every business experiences rise and fall, and in such falls, the financial leverage from debt/loan gives the investors better protection, which Facebook can not offer now due to its impressive 0. At such point, investors may consider withdrawing/stopping their investment, which can be a problem then.
